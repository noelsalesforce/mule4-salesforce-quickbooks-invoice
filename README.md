# QuickBooks Online Invoice and Salesforce Integration
This MuleSoft project demonstrates an integration between QuickBooks Online and Salesforce, where an invoice is created in QuickBooks when a specific condition is met in Salesforce, and related data is synchronized back to Salesforce.

### Connectors Used
- QuickBooks Online Connector: For creating invoices in QuickBooks.
- Salesforce Connector: To listen for modified Salesforce objects and update records accordingly.
- Slack Connector: For sending notifications (configured but not actively used in this flow).
